available under the site license (see the license block at the bottom
of this page). Users agree to the license when they register to use
the site for the first time. Typically that means that the data can
be copied far and wide, for commercial and non-commercial purposes,
and in modified or unmodified form. If you're not OK with that,
don't use the service.</li>

<li>Your profile information (including subscriptions and avatars) can be
downloaded and re-used by other services, either scraped from the HTML

including users on another sharing service.</li>
